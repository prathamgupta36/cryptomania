## Welcome to Cryptomania

This dojo is going to delve into concepts of crytpography starting from super simple to complicated topics.

Cryptography is derived from Greek words meaning "hidden writing". It is a practice of hiding our data from anyone it is not intended for. As our machines got better, cracking the secret data got easier which led to better practices of hiding that data. Throughout the dojo you will learn about basic concepts such as encryption, decryption, keys, and algorithms. We will define cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

Let your cryptography journey begin, Ό,τι καλύτερο!
