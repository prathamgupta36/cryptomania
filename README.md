# Cryptomania

## Description
This dojo is being actively developed to introduce cryptography from fundamentals to complex topics with a focus on visualization. 

Cryptography is derived from Greek words meaning "hidden writing". It is a practice of hiding our data from anyone it is not intended for. As our machines got better, cracking the secret data got easier which led to better practices of hiding that data. Throughout the dojo you will learn about basic concepts such as encryption, decryption, keys, and algorithms. We will define cryptographic algorithms and libraries. Equipped with all of this knowledge you will be able to examine real-world cryptographic protocols and their applications in securing communications and data.

This dojo is open-source and I welcome any contributions.
